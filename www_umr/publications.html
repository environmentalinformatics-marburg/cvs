<h4>Meyer H, Kühnlein M, Reudenbach C, Nauss T (submitted)<br />
Revealing the potential of spectral and texture variables in a neural
network based rainfall retrieval technique.<br />
Remote Sensing.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Estimating rainfall areas and rates from geostationary
satellite images has the opportunity of both, a high spatial and a high
temporal resolution which cannot be achieved by other satellite-based
systems until now.<br />
Most recent retrieval techniques base on the spectral channels of the
satellites as predictor variables solely. These retrievals can be
classified as "purely pixel-based" because no information about the
neighbourhood pixels is included. Assuming that precipitation is highly
correlated with cloud processes and therefore with cloud texture,
texture information derived from the neighbourhood of a pixel might
give valuable information about the cloud type and hence about a
respective probability of the rainfall rate.<br />
 To study the potential of texture variables to improve optical
rainfall retrieval techniques, rainfall area and rainfall rates were
predicted for Germany during summer 2010 using a neural network
approach. In addition to the spectral predictor variables from Meteosat
Second Generation (MSG), different grey level co-occurance matrix based
texture variables were calculated from all MSG channels. Models were
trained for the best performing predictor variables revealed during a
recursive feature selection. The performance was then compared to
models that used spectral predictors solely.<br />
Contrary to expectations, the performance of the models did not
increase when texture information were included. Therefore, it could be
shown that texture variables have no advantage in machine learning
based optical rainfall retrievals over spectral-only models.</em></p>

N-turnover and greenhouse gas emissions in a tropical alpine ecosystem
on Mt. Kilimanjaro.<br />
 Plant and Soil.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: The tropical alpine Helichrysum ecosystem at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, at 3880m altitude was investigated over a six day period for the magnitude of N turnover processes and CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions from soils with different vegetation cover. The study site host Erica shrubs which are unusual for this ecosystem. That allowed testing for future changes of biogeochemical processes regarding ascending shifts in Erica vegetation belt. Additionally, a rain experiment was conducted to examine turnover and emission changes by precipitation. Gross N turnover and greenhouse gas exchange were investigated using 15N pool dilution and static chamber method, respectively. Gross N mineralization, NH4+ immobilization rates and CO2 emissions were significant higher on the vegetated plots. However, results did not show significant differences between the no rain and the rain treatment except for N2O emissions. Relative N retention was higher on the plant covered plots. This study is the first presenting N turnover and greenhouse gas exchange in an afroalpine ecosystem. We conclude that i) precipitation has no significant influence on biogeochemical processes in Helichrysum ecosystem, ii) strong microbial competition for N and a long-term ecosystem internal nutrient retention is present, ii) N turnover processes increase if vegetation belts ascend.</em></p>

Predictive modelling of fractional woody cover in semi-arid savannahs
using multi-sensor and multi-seasonal data.<br />
Remote Sensing of Environment.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Effective monitoring of the Earth’s ecosystems requires the availability of methods for quantifying the structural composition and cover of vegetation. This is especially important in heterogeneous environments, such as semi-arid savannahs which are naturally comprised of a dynamic mix of tree, shrub, and grass components.The fractional coverage of woody vegetation is a key ecosystem attribute in savannahs, particularly given current concerns over the invasion of grasslands by shrub species (shrub encroachment), or the over-exploitation of woody biomass for fuelwood. Remote sensing has a clear role to play in monitoring semi-arid environments, and in recent years the number of both spacebourne sensors and collected scenes has increased dramatically allowing for multitemporal and multisensor investigations. Here we employ a statistical learning framework to assess the potential of optical and radar imagery for predicting fractional woody cover. Our results show that combining Landsat and PALSAR data produces the most accurate predictions (R2 0.65X,p &lt; 0.001,RMSE 0.094). However, this was only marginally more effective than a model using multitemporal Landsat data from the wet and dry seasons (R2 = 0.65XX, p &lt; 0.001,RMSE 0.094). When a single temporal epoch is employed, dry season data consistently and significantly outperforms imagery from the wet period. These results add to the growing literature on fractional cover prediction.</em></p>

A Scintillometer-based evapotranspiration-elevation gradient along the
southern slopes of Kilimanjaro.<br />
Agricultural and Forest Meteorology.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Future climate characteristics of the southern
Kilimanjaro region, Tanzania, are mainly determined by (i) global
climate change and (ii) local land-cover change. Considering increasing
dryness throughout the 20th century, land-cover change-induced
modifications of the hydrological cycle will have crucial impacts on
the local climate, thus demanding a proper knowledge of the water
balance-related components in the region. Here we present land
cover-specific evapotranspiration (ET) rates derived from a
surface-layer scintillometer measurement campaign. Sampling localities
cover climatic (940 to 3,960 m a.s.l.) and, at uniform elevation
levels, disturbance gradients, thus encompassing: colline savanna and
maize fields, submontane coffee plantations and grasslands, subalpine
Erica forest and shrubs, and lower alpine Helichrysum cushion
vegetation. At low altitudes, ET strictly follows the course of the sun
and is somewhat muted by water limitations at the colline level. While
such constraints do not impact the submontane zone, smaller ET amounts
again become evident at the (sub-)alpine level resulting from low
temperatures and high cloud and fog frequencies. Here, the diurnal ET
cycle peaks right after dawn possibly related with a high atmospheric
moisture deficit resulting from night frost. At uniform elevation
levels, natural and anthropogenic disturbance modifies the vegetation
structure and thereby amplifies soil evaporation through a higher share
of bare soil exposed to incident radiation. Accordingly, maize fields
(grasslands) reveal higher ET amounts than the denser savanna (coffee)
canopies, whereas no such differences become evident from the Erica
zone. To sum up, our results expose both global climate and local
land-cover change as key factors for ET-related water loss in the
region, and hence emphasize the importance of establishing a spatially
and temporally continuous monitoring network for all water
balance-related parameters.</em></p>

Mapping daily air temperature for Antarctica based on MODIS LST.<br />
Remote Sensing.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Abstract: Spatial predictions of near-surface air
temperature (T_air) in Antarctica are needed as a baseline for a
variety of research disciplines. Since the network of climate stations
in Antarctica is sparse, remote sensing based methods are required for
this task.<br />
Based on the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data, T_air was
modelled at a spatial resolution of 1 km using data from 32 stations as
reference. The performance of a simple linear regression model to
predict T_air from LST was compared to the performance of three machine
learning algorithms (random forest (RF), generalized boosted regression
models (GBM) and Cubist). In addition to LST, terrain attributes were
tested as additional predictors in these models. Their relevance was
evaluated by a Cubist-based forward feature selection in conjunction
with leave-one-station-out cross-validation to reduce the impact of
overfitting. GBM performed best to predict T_air using LST and the
month of the year as predictor variables. Using the trained model T_air
could be estimated with a leave-one-station-out cross-validated R2 of
0.71 and a RMSE of 10.53 °C. The machine learning approaches, however,
performed only slightly better than the simple linear estimation of
T_air from LST (R2 of 0.64, RMSE of 11.02 °C).<br />
Using the trained model allowed creating time series of T_air over
Antarctica for 2013. Extending the training data to further years will
allow developing time series of T_air from 1999 on.</em></p>

An on-demand processing database system for climate station data.<br />
Computers and Geosciences.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Small to medium-scale projects by geographers,
ecologists or other environmental scientists are generally not
backed-up by dedicated computer scientists although all kinds of
sensors with non-continuous measurement options are heavily utilized in
many research activities. The Tube Database (TubeDB) is intended to
offer an easy to operate software system to archive, quality control,
query and retrieve time series data in an efficient way. Data import is
realized by using raw formats as recorded by the respective sensors.
When a user requests data, a query to an on-demand processing unit is
created that builds an individual processing graph with the raw data as
a source. The processing graph may consist of typical preparation steps
for time series data such as temporal aggregation, quality checks,
interpolation of missing values and transformations. The user interface
is a desktop or web based application to accomplish easy access and on
the visualizations of time series and export functionality. In
addition, direct HTTP requests can be sent to the API.</em></p>

From local spectral measurements to maps of vegetation cover and
biomass on the Qinghai-Tibet-Plateau: Do we need hyperspectral
information?<br />
Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Though the relevance of pasture degradation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is widely postulated, its extent is still unknown. Due to the enormous spatial extent, remote sensing provides the only possibility to investigate pasture degradation via frequently used proxies such as vegetation cover and aboveground biomass (AGB). However, unified remote sensing approaches are still lacking. This study tests the applicability of hyper- and multispectral in situ measurements to map vegetation cover and AGB on regional scales. Using machine learning techniques, it is tested whether the full hyperspectral information is needed or if multispectral information is sufficient to accurately estimate pasture degradation proxies. To regionalize pasture degradation proxies, the transferability of the locally derived ML-models to high resolution multispectral satellite data is assessed. 1183 Hyperspectral measurements and vegetation records were performed at 18 locations on the QTP. Random Forests models with recursive feature selection were trained to estimate vegetation cover and AGB using narrow-band indices (NBI) as predictors. Separate models were calculated using NBI from hyperspectral data as well as from the same data resampled to WorldView-2, QuickBird and RapidEye channels. The hyperspectral results were compared to the multispectral results. Finally, the models were applied to satellite data to map vegetation cover and AGB on a regional scale. Vegetation cover was accurately predicted by Random Forest if hyperspectral measurements were used (cross validated R2~ 0.89). In contrast, errors in AGB estimations were considerably higher (cross validated R2 ~ 0.32). Only small differences in accuracy were observed between the models based on hyperspectral compared to multispectral data. The application of the models to satellite images generally resulted in an increase of the estimation error. Though this reflects the challenge of applying \textit{in situ} measurements to satellite data, the results still show a high potential to map pasture degradation proxies on the QTP. Thus, this study presents robust methodology to remotely detect and monitor pasture degradation at high spatial resolutions.</em></p>

Heterogeneous patterns of abundance of epigeic arthropod lineages along
a major elevation gradient.<br />
Biotropica.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Species diversity is the most common variable reported in recent ecological research articles. Ecological processes, however, are driven by individuals. High abundances make arthropods, despite their small body sizes, important actors in food webs. Understanding the variation in animal abundances along climatic gradients is important for predicting changes in ecosystem processes under global warming. Despite this, data on abundance distributions of major arthropod taxa along climatic gradients remains poorly documented. We sampled arthropod assemblages in disturbed and undisturbed vegetation types along an elevation gradient of 860-4550m asl on the southern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. In our analysis, we focused on 13 taxa of arthropods that represented three major functional groups: predators, herbivores and decomposers. Most of the taxa showed unimodal patterns of abundance with peaks at low elevations. When taxa were assigned to functional groups, abundance in undisturbed sites was largest in lower montane forest for all groups. In disturbed sites, abundance declined linearly, except for decomposers, who showed another peak in the land-use zone. When we assigned beetles to functional groups, however, decomposers showed almost linear decline, and predators (ca. 2400m asl) and herbivores (ca. 3000m asl) showed unimodal patterns with peaks a lot further up the slope, at least in undisturbed sites. Temperature, not primary productivity, was the best predictor for abundance for most of the taxa and groups. Disturbance was only of minor importance. In conclusion, we found different trends in the response of arthropod abundance along the elevation gradient which depended on the level of taxonomic and functional resolution. This highlights the need for more comparisons of different taxa along the same climatic gradients.</em></p>

Multi-decadal trends and inter-annual variability of rainfall as
observed from two lowland stations at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania.<br />
Journal of Hydrometeorology.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: The receding glaciers of Mt. Kilimanjaro have become a
synonym for global change but it is also the non-glaciated areas which
are changing. Future climate dynamics in the Kilimanjaro region will
mainly be influenced by both, global climate and local land-cover
change. An increase in precipitation is expected, but also rising
temperatures are predicted for the ecosystem. Aside from a brief
examination of air temperature, in-situ rainfall of two stations is
analyzed to determine seasonal and multi-decadal variability in the
lowlands and mid-elevation of the Kilimanjaro region. In-situ air
temperature is based on the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)
datasets provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), in-situ rainfall data is obtained from the
Tanzania Meteorological Agency. Both datasets cover a time span of 41
years, starting in 1973. While a temperature increase of about 0.27 K
per decade can be identified, no linear long-term trends in rainfall
are observable. However, humid and dry decades are evident and
seasonality has changed especially during the long rains between March
and May. ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) in combination with IOD
(Indian Ocean Dipole) leads to enhanced rainfall during the year of
ENSO onset and the following year. During La Nin~a years, rainfall
increases in the following year, while during the onset year rainfall
patterns are more diverse. Positive IOD leads to enhanced rainfall
amounts.</em></p>

Stable isotope characteristics of precipitation and soil water at the
southern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania.<br />
Hydrological Processes.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Understanding the isotopic variability of oxygen
(d18O) and hydrogen (dD) of precipitation has become essential for
determining sources of precipitation by using the stable isotope
composition as hydrological tracer. Isotope composition of
precipitation and soil water was determined for 2,271 samples collected
in a weekly interval over two years at eleven study sites along an
elevation transect ranging from 950 m a.s.l. to 3,880 m a.s.l. at the
southern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro. As precipitation in tropical
rainforests consists of a combination of rainfall, throughfall and fog,
we investigated the component specific stable isotope composition and
analyzed effects of amount and altitude. The amount of precipitation
along with air temperature was measured as well. We defined a Local
Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) of precipitation, namely dDprec = 7.45(±
0.05) x d18Oprec + 13.61(± 0.20) (n = 2,140; R² = 0.91***). Aggregated
annual mean values revealed isotope composition of rainfall as most
depleted and fog water as most enriched in heavy isotopes. We found an
significant, but relatively less pronounced altitude effect of&nbsp;
d18Orain = -0.12 ‰ * 100 m-1, which varies according to precipitation
type and seasonality. The weak altitude effect may reveal two different
moisture sources in the research area: (i) local moisture recycling and
(ii) regional moisture sources. Generally, the seasonality of d18Orain
values follows the bimodal rainfall distribution under the influences
of south- and northeasterly trade winds.</em></p>

Synergistic effects of climate and land use on avian beta
diversity.<br />
Ecography.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Gradients in climate and land use occur simultaneously in many of the Earth’s ecosystems and thus collectively impact most ecological communities. Albeit climate and land use have potentially interacting effects on ecological communities that may exacerbate or ameliorate their individual effects, little is known about the effect of the climate-land use interaction on community composition. A better understanding of the interaction between climate and land use is essential to predict the impacts of environmental change on ecological communities. We quantified the community composition of birds on 64 study plots of 13 different habitat types along an elevational gradient from 870 to 4550 m a.s.l. at Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. We partitioned the variation in pairwise beta diversity (ßcc) of birds and its two additive components, species richness differences (ßrich) and species replacement (ß-3), among the effects of temperature, land-use intensity and their interaction. Temperature and land use had synergistic effects on beta diversity (ßcc) of birds, i.e. the combination of high temperature and high land-use intensity led to higher beta diversity than expected from the sum of both individual effects. While temperature explained more of the variation in species richness differences(ßrich), land use explained more of the variation in species replacement (ß-3), indicating that different processes drove avian beta diversity along the temperature and land-use gradients. Our results challenge previous studies that investigated the effects of climate and land use in isolation, because disregarding their synergistic interaction underestimates the joint effect of climate and land use on biodiversity. A consideration of the synergy between climate and land use is essential for adequate predictions of the impact of global change on biodiversity.</em></p>

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.01.008</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: In mountain geosystems, rockfalls are among the most
effective sediment transfer processes, reflected in the regional-scale
distribution of talus slopes. However, the understanding of the key
controlling factors seems to decrease with increasing spatial scale,
due to emergent and complex system behavior and not least to recent
methodological shortcomings in rockfall modeling research. In this
study, we aim (i) to develop a new approach to identify major
regional-scale rockfall controls and (ii) to quantify the relative
importance of these controls. Using a talus slope inventory in the
Turtmann Valley (Swiss Alps), we applied for the first time the
decision-tree based random forest algorithm (RF) in combination with a
principal component logistic regression (PCLR) to evaluate the spatial
distribution of rockfall activity. This study presents new insights
into the discussion on whether periglacial rockfall events are
controlled more by topo-climatic, cryospheric, paraglacial or/and rock
mechanical properties.</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract: Bush encroachment of savannas and grasslands is a
common form of land degradation in the rangelands of South Africa. To
assess the carrying capacity of the land and to understand underlaying
processes of bush encroachment, continuous monitoring of this
phenomenon is needed. The aim of this study is to provide training
sites for satellite-based monitoring of bush encroachment in South
Africa on a medium spatial resolution satellite sensor (e.g. MODIS or
Landsat) scale. Since field surveys are time consuming and of limited
spatial extent, the satellite based creation of training sites using
Google Earth images is intended. Training pixels for woody vegetation
and non-woody land cover were manually digitized from 50 sample Google
Earth images. A Random Forests model was trained to delineate woody
from non-woody pixels. The results indicate a high performance of the
model (AUC = 0.97). The model was applied to a further 500 Google Earth

Comparison of four machine learning algorithms for their applicability
in satellite-based optical rainfall retrievals.</a><br />
Atmospheric Research 169, Part B:424–433. doi:
10.1016/j.atmosres.2015.09.021</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms have successfully
been demonstrated to be valuable tools in satellite-based rainfall
retrievals which show the practicability of using ML algorithms when
faced with high dimensional and complex data. Moreover, recent
developments in parallel computing with ML present new possibilities
for training and prediction speed and therefore make their usage in
real-time systems feasible. This study compares four ML algorithms —
random forests (RF), neural networks (NNET), averaged neural networks
(AVNNET) and support vector machines (SVM) — for rainfall area
detection and rainfall rate assignment using MSG SEVIRI data over
Germany. Satellite-based proxies for cloud top height, cloud top
temperature, cloud phase and cloud water path serve as predictor
variables. The results indicate an overestimation of rainfall area
delineation regardless of the ML algorithm (averaged bias = 1.8) but a
high probability of detection ranging from 81% (SVM) to 85% (NNET). On
a 24-hour basis, the performance of the rainfall rate assignment
yielded R2 values between 0.39 (SVM) and 0.44 (AVNNET). Though the
differences in the algorithms' performance were rather small, NNET and
AVNNET were identified as the most suitable algorithms. On average,
they demonstrated the best performance in rainfall area delineation as
well as in rainfall rate assignment. NNET's computational speed is an
additional advantage in work with large datasets such as in remote
sensing based rainfall retrievals. However, since no single algorithm
performed considerably better than the others we conclude that further
research in providing suitable predictors for rainfall is of greater
necessity than an optimization through the choice of the ML
algorithm.</em></p>

Comparative Study of Cross-Product NDVI Dynamics in the Kilimanjaro
Region – A Matter of Sensor, Degradation Calibration, and
Significance.</a><br />
Remote Sensing 8:159. doi: 10.3390/rs8020159</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: While satellite-based monitoring of vegetation
activity at the earth's surface is of vital importance for many
eco-climatological applications, the degree of agreement among certain
sensors and products providing estimates of the Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been found to vary considerably. In order
to assess the extent of such differences in highly heterogeneous
terrain, we analyze and compare intra-annual seasonal fluctuations and
long-term monotonic trends (2003–2012) in the Kilimanjaro region,
Tanzania. The considered NDVI datasets include the Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products from Terra and Aqua,
Collections 5 and 6, and the 3rd Generation Global Inventory Modeling
and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) product. The degree of agreement in
seasonal fluctuations is assessed by calculating a pairwise Index of
Association (IOAs), whereas long-term trends are derived from the
trend-free pre-whitened Mann–Kendall test. On the seasonal scale, the
two Terra-MODIS products (and, accordingly, the two Aqua-MODIS
products) are best associated with each other, indicating that the
seasonal signal remained largely unaffected by the new Collection 6
calibration approach. On the long-term scale, we find that the negative
impacts of band ageing on Terra-MODIS NDVI have been accounted for in
Collection 6, which now distinctly outweighs Aqua-MODIS in terms of
greening trends. GIMMS NDVI, by contrast, fails to capture small-scale
seasonal and trend patterns that are characteristic for the highly
fragmented landscape which is likely owing to the coarse spatial
resolution. As a short digression, we also demonstrate that the amount
of false discoveries in the determined trend fraction is distinctly
higher for p &lt; 0.05 ( 52.6 % ) than for p &lt; 0.001 ( 2.2 % ) which
should point the way for any future studies focusing on the reliable
deduction of long-term monotonic trends.<br />

in the Pacific (El Niño Southern Oscillation, ENSO) and Indian Ocean
(Indian Ocean Dipole, IOD) are known to severely impact rainfall
patterns and vegetation activity in the study area and possibly
reinforce each other. Here we present long-term and seasonal vegetation
dynamics derived from a GIMMS-based NDVI record resampled to 1 km
spatial resolution and covering a 30-year period (1982–2011). In the
long term, most of the upper mountain regions showed positive trends
which was mainly attributed to vegetation recovery after disastrous
fires during the outgoing 20th century. Along the western mountainside,
by contrast, strong negative trends emerged as a consequence of
fire-driven downward migration of Erica bush along the upper slopes and
massive land conversion processes affecting the lower slopes. On the
seasonal scale, a strong dependence of the regional vegetation on the
effects of ENSO/IOD teleconnections became evident. Similar to previous
findings on rainfall, the most beneficial effects occurred during
concurrent El Niño/IOD events, while the impacts of La Niña were far
less pronounced. To sum up, the newly created 1-km NDVI record proved
capable of capturing long-term and seasonal vegetation patterns, which
particularly applies for large-scale teleconnections, and thus provides
an invaluable archive of decadal-scale vegetation dynamics in the study
area.</em></p>

Spatial Patterns of Sea Surface Temperature Influences on East African
Precipitation as Revealed by Empirical Orthogonal

Atmospheric Science 3. doi: 10.3389/feart.2016.00003</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: East Africa is characterized by a rather dry annual
precipitation climatology with two distinct rainy seasons. In order to
investigate sea surface temperature driven precipitation anomalies for
the region we use the algorithm of empirical orthogonal teleconnection
analysis as a data mining tool. We investigate the entire East African
domain as well as 5 smaller sub-regions mainly located in areas of
mountainous terrain. In searching for influential sea surface
temperature patterns we do not focus any particular season or oceanic
region. Furthermore, we investigate different time lags from 0 to 12
months. The strongest influence is identified for the immediate (i.e.,
non-lagged) influences of the Indian Ocean in close vicinity to the
East African coast. None of the most important modes are located in the
tropical Pacific Ocean, though the region is sometimes coupled with the
Indian Ocean basin. Furthermore, we identify a region in the southern
Indian Ocean around the Kerguelen Plateau which has not yet been
reported in the literature with regard to precipitation modulation in
East Africa. Finally, it is observed that not all regions in East
Africa are equally influenced by the identified patterns.</em></p>

Retrieval of grassland plant coverage on the Tibetan Plateau based on a

Remote Sensing of Environment 164:197–207. doi:
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.04.020</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Plant coverage is a basic indicator of the biomass
production in ecosystems. On the Tibetan Plateau, the biomass of
grasslands provides major ecosystem services with regard to the
predominant transhumance economy. The pastures, however, are threatened
by progressive degradation, resulting in a substantial reduction in
plant coverage with currently unknown consequences for the
hydrological/climate regulation function of the plateau and the major
river systems of SE Asia that depend on it and provide water for the
adjacent lowlands. Thus, monitoring of changes in plant coverage is of
utmost importance, but no reliable tools have been available to date to
monitor the changes on the entire plateau. Due to the wide extent and
remoteness of the Tibetan Plateau, remote sensing is the only tool that
can recurrently provide area-wide data for monitoring purposes. In this
study, we develop and present a grassland-cover product based on
multi-sensor satellite data that is applicable for monitoring at three
spatial resolutions (WorldView type at 2–5 m, Landsat type at 30 m,
MODIS at 500 m), where the data of the latter resolution cover the
entire plateau. Four different retrieval techniques to derive plant
coverage from satellite data in boreal summer (JJA) were tested. The
underlying statistical models are derived with the help of field
observations of the cover at 640 plots and 14 locations, considering
the main grassland vegetation types of the Tibetan Plateau. To provide
a product for the entire Tibetan Plateau, plant coverage estimates
derived by means of the higher-resolution data were upscaled to MODIS
composites acquired between 2011 and 2013. An accuracy assessment of
the retrieval methods revealed best results for the retrieval using
support vector machine regressions (RMSE: 9.97%, 7.13% and 5.51% from
the WorldView to the MODIS scale). The retrieved values coincide well
with published coverage data on the different grassland vegetation
types.</em></p>

versus resource constraints: which factors determine bee diversity on
Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania?</a><br />
Global Ecology and Biogeography 24:642–652. doi: 10.1111/geb.12286</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms controlling variation in
species richness along environmental gradients is one of the most
important objectives in ecology. Resource availability is often
considered as the major driver of animal diversity. However, in
ectotherms, temperature might play a predominant role as it modulates
metabolic rates and the access of animals to resources. Here, we
investigate the relative importance of resource availability and
temperature in determining the diversity pattern of bees along a 3.6-km
elevational gradient. We assessed bee species richness and abundance
with pan traps and floral resources with transect records on 60 study
sites which were equally distributed over six near-natural and six
disturbed habitat types along an elevational gradient from 870 to
4550?m a.s.l. We used path analysis to disentangle the effects of
temperature, precipitation, floral resource abundance, bee abundance
and land use on bee species richness. In addition, we monitored flower
visitation rates during transect walks at different elevations to
evaluate the temperature dependence of bee–flower interactions. Bee
species richness continuously declined with elevation in natural and
disturbed habitats. While the abundance of floral resources had a
significant but only weak effect on species richness, the effect of
temperature was strong. Temperature had a strong positive effect on
species richness that was not mediated by bee abundance and an indirect
effect via bee abundances. We observed higher levels of bee–flower
interactions at higher temperatures, supporting the hypothesis that
temperature limits diversity by constraining resource exploitation in
ectotherms.<br />

Tanzania, since 2010 and presents the recorded characteristics of air
temperature, air humidity and precipitation in both a plot-based and
area-wide perspectives. The station set-up follows a hierarchical

temperature and above-ground air humidity and 11 precipitation
measurement sites, with recording intervals of 5?min. With respect to
precipitation observations, the network extends the long-term
recordings of A. Hemp who has installed and maintained up to 117
multi-month accumulating rainfall buckets in the region since 1997. The
meteorological characteristics of the study region based on the derived
data since 2010 are mostly in line with previous studies, although we
see increased precipitation amounts at higher elevations during these
years when compared with long-term means. We furthermore identify a
mean annual condensation level at about 2300?m?a.s.l. which has not
been reported before. Finally, this is the first study to provide high

and precipitation for Kilimanjaro, which are of great value for
geographically oriented meteorological or ecological investigations.
Detailed performance statistics of the geo-statistical and machine

testing design, regression trees generally perform better than linear
and non-linear regression models. The best individual performance has
been observed by the stochastic gradient boosting model followed by
Cubist, random forest and model averaged neural networks which except
for the latter are all regression tree-based algorithms. While these
machine learning algorithms perform better than kriging in a
quantitative evaluation, the overall visual interpretation of the
resulting air temperature maps is ambiguous. Here, a combined Cubist
and residual kriging approach can be considered the best

collected with automated sensor networks as a case study. Two
approaches to geostatistical modeling and spatio-temporal predictions
are described: (1) 3D + T predictive modeling using random forests
algorithms, and (2) 3D + T kriging model after detrending the
observations for depth-dependent seasonal effects. All the analyses
used data from the Cook Agronomy Farm (37 ha), which includes hourly
measurements of soil volumetric water content, temperature, and bulk
electrical conductivity at 42 stations and five depths (0.3, 0.6, 0.9,
1.2, and 1.5 m), collected over five years. This data set also includes
2- and 3-dimensional, temporal, and spatio-temporal covariates covering
the same area. The results of (strict) leave-one-station-out
cross-validation indicate that both models accurately predicted soil
temperature, while predictive power was lower for water content, and
lowest for electrical conductivity. The kriging model explained 37%,
96%, and 18% of the variability in water content, temperature, and
electrical conductivity respectively versus 34%, 93%, and 5% explained
by the random forests model. A less rigorous simple cross-validation of
the random forests model indicated improved predictive power when at
least some data were available for each station, explaining 86%, 97%,
and 88% of the variability in water content, temperature, and
electrical conductivity respectively. The high difference between the
strict and simple cross-validation indicates high temporal
auto-correlation of values at measurement stations. Temporal model
components (i.e. day of the year and seasonal trends) explained most of
the variability in observations in both models for all three variables.
The seamless predictions of 3D + T data produced from this analysis can
assist in understanding soil processes and how they change through a
season, under different land management scenarios, and how they relate
to other environmental processes.<br />

Improving the accuracy of rainfall rates from optical satellite sensors
with machine learning – A random forests-based approach applied to MSG
SEVIRI.</a><br />
Remote Sensing of Environment 141:129–143. doi:
10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.026</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: The present study aims to investigate the potential of
the random forests ensemble classification and regression technique to
improve rainfall rate assignment during day, night and twilight
(resulting in 24-hour precipitation estimates) based on cloud physical
properties retrieved from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning
Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) data. Random forests (RF)
models contain a combination of characteristics that make them well
suited for its application in precipitation remote sensing. One of the
key advantages is the ability to capture non-linear association of
patterns between predictors and response which becomes important when
dealing with complex non-linear events like precipitation. Due to the
deficiencies of existing optical rainfall retrievals, the focus of this
study is on assigning rainfall rates to precipitating cloud areas in
connection with extra-tropical cyclones in mid-latitudes including both
convective and advective-stratiform precipitating cloud areas. Hence,
the rainfall rates are assigned to rain areas previously identified and
classified according to the precipitation formation processes. As
predictor variables water vapor-IR differences and IR cloud top
temperature are used to incorporate information on cloud top height.
?T8.7–10.8 and ?T10.8–12.1 are considered to supply information about
the cloud phase. Furthermore, spectral SEVIRI channels (VIS0.6, VIS0.8,
NIR1.6) and cloud properties (cloud effective radius, cloud optical
thickness) are used to include information about the cloud water path
during daytime, while suitable combinations of temperature differences
(?T3.9–10.8, ?T3.9–7.3) are considered during night-time. The
development of the rainfall rate retrieval technique is realised in
three steps. First, an extensive tuning study is carried out to
customise each of the RF models. The daytime, night-time and twilight
precipitation events have to be treated separately due to differing
information content about the cloud properties between the different
times of day. Secondly, the RF models are trained using the optimum
values for the number of trees and number of randomly chosen predictor
variables found in the tuning study. Finally, the final RF models are
used to predict rainfall rates using an independent validation data set
and the results are validated against co-located rainfall rates
observed by a ground radar network. To train and validate the model,
the radar-based RADOLAN RW product from the German Weather Service
(DWD) is used which provides area-wide gauge-adjusted hourly
precipitation information. Regarding the overall performance, as
indicated by the coefficient of determination (Rsq), hourly rainfall
rates show already a good correlation with Rsq = 0.5 (day and night)
and Rsq = 0.48 (twilight) between the satellite and radar based
observations. Higher temporal aggregation leads to better agreement.
Rsq rises to 0.78 (day), 0.77 (night) and 0.75 (twilight) for 8-h
interval. By comparing day, night and twilight performance it becomes
evident that daytime precipitation is generally predicted best by the
model. Twilight and night-time predictions are generally less accurate
but only by a small margin. This may due to the smaller number of
predictor variables during twilight and night-time conditions as well
as less favourable radiative transfer conditions to obtain the cloud
parameters during these periods. However, the results show that with
the newly developed method it is possible to assign rainfall rates with
good accuracy even on an hourly basis. Furthermore, the rainfall rates
can be assigned during day, night and twilight conditions which enables
the estimation of rainfall rates 24 h day.</em></p>

retrieved from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced

carried out for each individual step as well as for the overall

individual step, the models for rain area and convective precipitation
detection produce good results. Both retrieval steps show a general
tendency toward elevated prediction skill during summer months and

performance patterns, yet it is noteworthy how well the model is able
to predict rainfall rates during nighttime and twilight. The
performance of the overall procedure shows a very promising potential
to estimate rainfall rates at high temporal and spatial resolutions in
an automated manner. The near-real-time continuous applicability of the

<p><em>Abstract: Knowledge of cloud properties such as cloud effective
radius (aef) and optical thickness (t) is essential to understand their
role in the dynamic radiation budget and climate change. The Spinning
Enhanced Visible and Infrared Instrument (SEVIRI) on board Meteosat
Second Generation (MSG) with its high temporal resolution (15 min),
permits a quasi-continuous monitoring of the evolution of cloud
properties. This has motivated the adaptation of the SLALOM (SimpLe
Approximations for cLOudy Media) algorithm, a semi-analytical cloud
property retrieval technique to MSG SEVIRI. The optical properties
retrieved by SLALOM are compared against the well known and validated
NASA MODIS cloud property product (MODIS 06) as well as the cloud
optical depth product (2B-TAU) of CloudSat. The results are shown over
the North Atlantic and over the European continent with the intention
of determine the relative accuracy between SLALOM and the other
retrievals. Over the North Atlantic, SLALOM-based cloud properties
retrieved from SEVIRI datasets show a good agreement with the MODIS 06
product with correlation coefficients of 0.93 (t) and 0.82 (aef). The
largest deviations were found in less homogeneous cloud areas that are
characterized by broken clouds and toward the cloud borders. Moreover,
SLALOM optical thickness values are well within the range of
corresponding CloudSat 2B-TAU optical thickness values which can be
found within a SEVIRI pixel, except for t &lt; 5 where SLALOM tends to
overestimate t. Despite the different sensor characteristics and
viewing geometries, the retrieved cloud properties compare very well.
Over Europe, the evaluation between SLALOM and MODIS 06 showed larger
differences. We attribute this to (a) uncertainties related to the
surface albedo which is treated differently in the algorithms and is
based on different albedo maps and (b) inhomogeneities of clouds which
exhibit quite complex structures particularly over land. The latter are
detected on different scales by MODIS and SEVIRI because of their
different spatial resolutions. Given the demonstrated accuracy of
SLALOM using MSG SEVIRI data there is a wide spread of potential
applications.<br />

manifestations of our ecosystem (pastures and natural vegetation) with
special considerations to the ecosystem regulation service by
converting natural forest into pasture. The results reveal a clear
differentiation over the year, partly triggered by the change of
synoptic weather situation but also by land cover effects. Humidity
amplitudes are particularly low during the main rainy season when
cloudiness and rainfall are high, but markedly pronounced in the
relative dry season when daily irradiance and outgoing nocturnal
radiation causes distinct differences between the land cover units.
Particularly the upper pasture areas gained by slash and burn of the
natural forest exhibit the lowest humidity values while the humidity
inside the mountain forest is significantly higher due to the
regulating effects of the dense vegetation. Thus, clearing the forest
clearly reduces the regulation function (regulating ecosystem services)
of the ecosystem which might become problematic for reforestation under
future global warming.</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract: Ecosystems provide services necessary for the
livelihoods and well-being of people. Quantifying and mapping supplies
and demands of ecosystem services is essential for continuous
monitoring of such services to support decision-making. Area-wide and
spatially explicit mapping of ecosystem services based on extensive
ground surveys is restricted to local scales and limited due to high
costs. In contrast, remote sensing provides reliable area-wide data for
quantifying and mapping ecosystem services at comparatively low costs,
and with the option of fast, frequent, and continuous observations for
monitoring. In this paper, we review relevant remote sensing systems,
sensor types, and methods applicable in quantifying selected

<p><em>Abstract: A complex interaction of local meteorology and source
characteristics regularly leads to nocturnal smog events during winter
in Christchurch, New Zealand. The main focus of this article is on
improving understanding of the relationship between atmospheric
processes operating at a range of scales that leads to poor air quality
in such urban environments. This research therefore aims to provide a
quantitative analysis of atmospheric influences on particulate matter
pollution in Christchurch across a wide range of spatial and temporal
scales, from local to hemispheric and daily to interannual. The
probability of exceeding the National Environmental Standard for PM10
for a range of local atmospheric conditions is calculated using the
classification and regression trees technique, and links between these
probabilities, local meteorology and synoptic weather situations are
established. The effect of the transition between synoptic types on
local air quality is also examined, and the progression of anticyclones
across the country is identified to be the dominant synoptic control
mechanism. It is shown that variation in latitudinal location of the
path of anticyclones over New Zealand influences the predicted
exceedance probability. On interdecadal and hemispheric scales, it is
found that the particular combination of local and synoptic atmospheric
conditions that favours air quality degradation shows a reoccurring
pattern of frequency maxima (and minima) with a periodicity of
approximately 14-16 years. In relation to the identified interdecadal
variability of synoptic circulation, a close relationship to Southern
Hemisphere pressure anomalies at high latitudes is revealed. The
results of this research show that, in addition to daily weather
variation, air quality in Christchurch is influenced by longer-term
climatic processes that operate on interannual hemispheric scales with
the implication that, in general, air pollution potential can also be
expected to vary on a periodic interdecadal time scale.<br />

<p><em>Abstract: In this paper, the central Pacific cold event of 2008
and its exceptionally warm conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific
are analyzed by using rainfall data of south Ecuadorian meteorological
stations, sea surface temperatures in the El Niño3 and 1+2 regions, and
simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. It
can be shown that El Niño-like rainfall conditions with severe
inundations occur particularly in the coastal plains of southern
Ecuador while a central Pacific cold event prevails. In contrary to
previous situations, positive rainfall anomalies as a result of El
Niño-like conditions in the El Niño1+2 region during the 2008 La Niña
event occurred in both regions, the coastal plains and the highlands,
for the first time. A detailed analysis of the ocean-atmosphere system
during episodes of heavy rainfall reveals typical El Niño circulation
and rainfall patterns as observed during previous El Niño events for
the coastal area and La Niña-like conditions for the highlands. The
spreading of Pacific instability in the Niño1+2 region to the eastern
escarpment of the Andes could be the result of a temporary eastward
shift of the Walker circulation. The unusual combination of El
Niño-like conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific during a La Niña
state in the central Pacific is the newest indicator for an impact mode
shift regarding severe rainfall anomalies during El Niño/La Niña events
in the traditional El Niño area of southern Ecuador since the end of
the last century. Since 2000, El Niño events unexpectedly provide below
average rainfall while central Pacific La Niña conditions generate
exceptional severe flooding in the normally drier coastal plains. The
novel sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly dipole structure between
the eastern and central/western tropical Pacific and the weakening of
El Niño events since 2000 could be due to natural decadal oscillations
in the El Niño background state, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).
However, the observed atmospheric patterns and the recent increase of
the SST anomaly difference between the central and the eastern tropical
Pacific resemble structures that also result from climate change
simulations.</em></p>

different forest types, the subpáramo and a succession stage of pasture

experimental setup with a field spectrometer covering the radiation
between 305 and 1305 nm. The results of the optical properties of all

to the composition of species of the predefined PFTs. Furthermore the
results are compared to other studies, the default values for the
globally defined PFT of tropical evergreen trees in the CLM and another
forest growth model operated in the same study area. The results show
that the clusters aggregated by the reflectance, transmittance or

transfer model CLOUD. These approximations enable a solution of the
equations of the corresponding backward model during runtime leading to
a very fast computation speed. Since these asymptotic solutions are
generally applicable to weakly absorbing media only, pre-calculated
look-up tables for the reflection function of a semi-infinite cloud

within this new retrieval. SLALOM is capable of retrieving the cloud
optical thickness, the effective cloud droplet radius, the liquid and

<p><em>Abstract: Tehran, the mega-city capital of Iran, suffers from
high concentrations of PM10 throughout the year. Emissions from
transport combined with mesoscale atmospheric features related to the
mountainous terrain lead to a distinctive diurnal pattern in
concentrations. Air quality data from monitoring stations show that the
highest concentrations of PM10 are in the morning and evening periods,
associated with peak traffic volumes and transition in local
meteorology from a stable nocturnal down-slope flow to a daytime
upslope regime. There is a clear north-south gradient in PM10
associated with the transport by down-slope winds. A year-long
simulation with The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) confirms the mesoscale
meteorological regime over Tehran. Simulation results indicate that the

<p><em>Abstract: The potential of rainfall-rate assignment using
Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared
Instrument (SEVIRI) data is investigated. For this purpose, a new
conceptual model for precipitation processes in connection with
midlatitude cyclones is developed, based on the assumption that high
rainfall rates are linked to a high optical thickness and a large
effective particle radius, whereas low rainfall rates are linked to a
low optical thickness and a small effective particle radius. Reflection
values in the 0.56–0.71-µm (VIS0.6) and 1.5–1.78-µm (NIR1.6) channels,
which provide information about the optical thickness and the effective
radius, are considered in lieu of the optical and microphysical cloud
properties. An analysis of the relationship between VIS0.6 and NIR1.6
reflection and the ground-based rainfall rate revealed a high
correlation between the sensor signal and the rainfall rate. Based on
these findings, a method for rainfall-rate assignment as a function of
VIS0.6 and NIR1.6 reflection is proposed. The validation of the
proposed technique showed encouraging results, especially for temporal
resolutions of 6 and 12 h. This is a significant improvement compared
to existing IR retrievals, which obtain comparable results for monthly
resolution. The existing relationship between the VIS0.6 and NIR1.6
reflection values and the ground-based rainfall rate is corroborated
with the new conceptual model. The good validation results indicate the
high potential for rainfall retrieval in the midlatitudes with the high
spatial and temporal resolution provided by MSG SEVIRI.</em></p>

Air Quality and Climate Change 44:24–29.</h4>
<p><em>Abstract: Prognostic air pollution models such as TAPM are used
to study air pollution on multi-day to multi-seasonal scales, driven by
daily synoptic forcings. In complex terrain, mesoscale regimes can
introduce diurnally reversing wind systems that can be persistent
features of low level climatology - especially during stagnant
anti-cyclonic conditions that result in deterioration of air quality.
In this study, TAPM is modified to ignore synoptic forcings yet still
produce terrain induced flows that are common features over the
Canterbury Plains in New Zealand. In addition, surface-based
climatology for two different regimes is assimilated into the model in
order to study their effects on temporal evolution of PM10. Two common
modes of surface wind conditions are observed in Christchurch during
evenings of high pollution days where the national guideline for PM10
is exceeded. Low level flow during the evening hours with generally low
wind speeds is dominated by either a north-westerly or a south-westerly
wind direction. Results from TAPM simulations of dispersion indicate
north-easterly flow opposes north-westerly to westerly drainage flow
from the Southern Alps and traps pollutants over the city for an
increased period of time and therewith delays flushing by a few hours.
Simulated pollution levels during the evening are close to observed
values and indicate that atmospheric control mechanisms are simulated
well. This study delivers a viable tool for local environmental
monitoring authorities to estimate generalised spatiotemporal pollution
behaviour under different low level flow conditions.</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract: Cedrela montana is a deciduous broad-leaved tree
species growing in the humid mountain rainforests of southern Ecuador.
High-resolution dendrometer data indicate a regular seasonal growth
rhythm with cambial activity during January to April. Amplitudes of
daily radial stem diameter variations are correlated with the amount of
the maximum daily vapour pressure deficit. During humid periods, daily
stem diameter variations are considerably smaller than during drier
periods. This indicates that cambial activity is limited by available
moisture even in such a very humid mountain climate. Wood anatomical
studies on microcores show the formation of a marginal parenchyma band
at the beginning of the growth period. This parenchyma band can be used
to delineate annual growth rings. We were able to establish the first
ring-width chronology from Cedrela montana which covers the time until
1840. However, the chronology is presently statistically robust back to
1910 only. Correlation functions calculated with NCEP/NCAR data
indicate a significantly positive relationship of tree growth with
temperatures during the growth period during January to April. However,
only 8% of the growth variance is explained by this climatic factor. In
the future, this relationship may be useful to reconstruct past

<p><em>Abstract: This study examines the seasonal and diurnal dynamics
of convective cloud entities—small cells and a mesoscale convective
complex–like pattern—in the foothills of the tropical eastern Andes.
The investigation is based on Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite-East (GOES-E) satellite imagery (2005–07), images of a
scanning X-band rain radar, and data from regular meteorological
stations. The work was conducted in the framework of a major ecological
research program, the Research Unit 816, in which meteorological
instruments are installed in the Rio San Francisco valley, breaching
the eastern Andes of south Ecuador. GOES image segmentation to
discriminate convective cells and other clouds is performed for a 600 ×
600 km2 target area, using the concept of connected component labeling
by applying the 8-connectivity scheme as well as thresholds for minimum
blackbody temperature, spatial extent, and eccentricity of the
extracted components. The results show that the formation of convective
clouds in the lowland part of the target area mainly occurs in austral
summer during late afternoon. Nocturnal enhancement of cell formation
could be observed from October to April (particularly February–April)
between 0100 and 0400 LST (LST = UTC - 5 h) in the Andean foothill
region of the target area, which is the relatively dry season of the
adjacent eastern Andean slopes. Nocturnal cell formation is especially
marked southeast of the Rio San Francisco valley in the southeast Andes
of Ecuador, where a confluence area of major katabatic outflow systems
coincide with a quasi-concave shape of the Andean terrain line. The
confluent cold-air drainage flow leads to low-level instability and
cellular convection in the warm, moist Amazon air mass. The novel
result of the current study is to provide statistical evidence that,
under these special topographic situations, katabatic outflow is strong
enough to generate mainly mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs) with a
great spatial extent. The MCC-like systems often increase in expanse
during their mature phase and propagate toward the Andes because of the
prevailing upper-air easterlies, causing early morning peaks of
rainfall in the valley of the Rio San Francisco. It is striking that
MCC formation in the foothill area is clearly reduced during the main
rainy season [June–August (JJA)] of the higher eastern Andean slopes.
At a first glance, this contradiction can be explained by rainfall
persistence in the Rio San Francisco valley, which is clearly lower
during the time of convective activity (December–April) in comparison
with JJA, during which low-intensity rainfall is released by
predominantly advective clouds with greater temporal
endurance.</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract: The thermal structure of a megadiverse mountain
ecosystem in southern Ecuador is examined on the basis of temperature
measurements inside the natural mountain forest and at open-sites along
an altitudinal gradient from 1600 to 3200 m. The main methodological
aim of the current study is to develop an air temperature
regionalization tool to provide spatial datasets on average monthly
mean, minimum and maximum temperature by using observation data. The
maps, based on data of the period 1999–2007, are needed by ecological
projects working on various plots where no climate station data are
available. The temperature maps are generated by combining a
straightforward detrending technique with a Digital Elevation Model and
a satellite-based land cover classification which also provides the
relative forest cover per pixel. The topical aim of the study is to
investigate the thermal structure of both manifestations of our
ecosystem (pastures and natural vegetation) with special considerations
to the ecosystem temperature regulation service by converting natural
forest into pasture. The results reveal a clear thermal differentiation
over the year, partly triggered by the change of synoptic weather
situation but also by land cover effects. Thermal amplitudes are
particularly low during the main rainy season when cloudiness and air
humidity are high, but markedly pronounced in the relative dry season
when daily irradiance and outgoing nocturnal radiation cause distinct
differences between the land cover units. Particularly the lower
pasture areas gained by slash and burn of the natural forest exhibit
the most extreme thermal conditions while the atmosphere inside the
mountain forest is slightly cooler due to the regulating effects of the
dense vegetation. Thus, clearing the forest clearly reduces the thermal
regulation function (regulating ecosystem services) of the ecosystem
which might become problematic under future global warming.</em></p>

for pasture management. Field observations suggest that bracken might
outcompete the grass due to its competitive strength with regard to the
absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). To understand
the PAR absorption potential of both species, the aims of the current
paper are to (1) parameterize a radiation scheme of a two-big-leaf
model by deriving structural (LAI, leaf angle parameter) and optical
(leaf albedo, transmittance) plant traits for average individuals from
field surveys, (2) to initialize the properly parameterized radiation
scheme with realistic global irradiation conditions of the Rio San
Francisco Valley in the Andes of southern Ecuador, and (3) to compare
the PAR absorption capabilities of both species under typical local
weather conditions. Field data show that bracken reveals a slightly
higher average leaf area index (LAI) and more horizontally oriented
leaves in comparison to Setaria. Spectrometer measurements reveal that
bracken and Setaria are characterized by a similar average leaf
absorptance. Simulations with the average diurnal course of incoming
solar radiation (1998–2005) and the mean leaf–sun geometry reveal that
PAR absorption is fairly equal for both species. However, the
comparison of typical clear and overcast days show that two parameters,
(1) the relation of incoming diffuse and direct irradiance, and (2) the
leaf–sun geometry play a major role for PAR absorption in the
two-big-leaf approach: Under cloudy sky conditions (mainly diffuse
irradiance), PAR absorption is slightly higher for Setaria while under
clear sky conditions (mainly direct irradiance), the average bracken
individual is characterized by a higher PAR absorption potential. (~74
MJ m-2 year-1). The latter situation which occurs if the maximum daily
irradiance exceeds 615 W m-2 is mainly due to the nearly orthogonal
incidence of the direct solar beam onto the horizontally oriented frond
area which implies a high amount of direct PAR absorption during the
noon maximum of direct irradiance. Such situations of solar irradiance
favoring a higher PAR absorptance of bracken occur in ~36% of the
observation period (1998–2005). By considering the annual course of PAR
irradiance in the San Francisco Valley, the clear advantage of bracken
on clear days (36% of all days) is completely compensated by the slight
but more frequent advantage of Setaria under overcast conditions (64%
of all days). This means that neither bracken nor Setaria show a
distinct advantage in PAR absorption capability under the current
climatic conditions of the study area.</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract: A land-cover classification is needed to deduce
surface boundary conditions for a soil–vegetation–atmosphere transfer
(SVAT) scheme that is operated by a geoecological research unit working
in the Andes of southern Ecuador. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
(ETM+) data are used to classify distinct vegetation types in the
tropical mountain forest. Besides a hard classification, a soft
classification technique is applied. Dempster–Shafer evidence theory is
used to analyse the quality of the spectral training sites and a
modified linear spectral unmixing technique is selected to produce
abundancies of the spectral endmembers. The hard classification
provides very good results, with a Kappa value of 0.86. The
Dempster–Shafer ambiguity underlines the good quality of the training
sites and the probability guided spectral unmixing is chosen for the
determination of plant functional types for the land model. A similar
model run with a spatial distribution of land cover from both the hard

model results by using the land surface based on the probability guided

<p><em>Abstract:A new day and night technique for precipitation process
separation and rainfall intensity differentiation using the Meteosat
Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager is
proposed. It relies on the conceptual design that convective clouds
with higher rainfall intensities are characterized by a larger vertical
extension and a higher cloud top. For advective-stratiform
precipitation areas, it is assumed that areas with a higher cloud water
path (CWP) and more ice particles in the upper parts are characterized
by higher rainfall intensities. First, the rain area is separated into
areas of convective and advective-stratiform precipitation processes.
Next, both areas are divided into subareas of differing rainfall
intensities. The classification of the convective area relies on
information about the cloud top height gained from water vapor-IR
differences and the IR cloud top temperature. The subdivision of the
advective-stratiform area is based on information about the CWP and the
particle phase in the upper parts. Suitable combinations of temperature
differences (?T3.9–10.8, ?T3.9–7.3, ?T8.7–10.8, ?T10.8–12.1) are
incorporated to infer information about the CWP during nighttime, while
a visible and a near-IR channel are considered during the daytime.
?T8.7–10.8 and ?T10.8–12.1 are particularly included to supply
information about the cloud phase. Intensity differentiation is
realized by using pixel-based confidences for each subarea calculated
as a function of the respective value combinations of the previously
mentioned variables. For the calculation of the confidences, the value
combinations are compared with ground-based radar data. The proposed
technique is validated against ground-based radar data and shows an
encouraging performance (Heidke skill score 0.07–0.2 for 15-min

<p><em>Abstract: To date, the annual and diurnal pattern of low clouds
touching the ground in tropical mountains is widely unknown. This holds
true for the valley of the Rio San Francisco in southern Ecuador, and
is mainly due to a lack of routine cloud observations, which is
symptomatic for remote areas in tropical high mountains. A method to
use a simple and cost-effective WebCam system for a quantitative
analysis of cloud frequency as a proxy for the occurrence of low-cloud
bases touching the ground is introduced. An interactive classification
tool is developed, which is applied to a comprehensive dataset of 32
452 images (during the years 2002–2004) archived at 5 min intervals.
The results point to a rapid increase of cloud frequency at altitudes
&gt; 2600 m asl both during the day and the year, mainly caused by
advective clouds veiling the crests of the Cordillera del Consuelo.
Even if the formation of radiation fog directly at the valley bottom is
nearly negligible with regard to the whole dataset, scatterometer
measurements suggest that valley fog formation on the slopes is a
regular process during the night, causing a clear drop in the cloud
base around sunrise. The interaction of low-radiative and
high-advective clouds is supposed to be the driving factor for a
rainfall maximum at the valley bottom around sunrise. Higher values of
cloud frequency still exist at the crest level around noon: these
originate from well-developed upslope-breeze systems.</em></p>

structure, amplitude and location of the precipitation field in a
predefined area. We also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of
each of the scores. The aim of our evaluation was to unfold the
strengths and weaknesses of AtmoMM5 and AtmoSat to calculate daily and
monthly high resolution precipitation. As a result we found that the
catchment averaged monthly mean precipitation is simulated with an
acceptable accuracy by both methods. The spatial pattern of the monthly
precipitation (typically with a precipitation maximum in the alpine
foreland) can only be reproduced by AtmoMM5. Regarding the daily
precipitation, our evaluation revealed that both methods still need
improvement. The deviations to the observations increase with
decreasing precipitation amount resulting in large uncertainties in
case of very dry conditions. Overall, we can conclude that AtmoMM5 is
better suited to simulate precipitation at 5 km resolution on a daily

<p><em>Abstract: A scheme for the detection of fog and low stratus over

Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument is presented. The method is based
on an initial threshold test procedure in the MODIS solar bands 1–7
(0.62–2.155µm). Fog and low stratus detection generally relies on the
definition of minimum and maximum fog and low stratus properties, which
are converted to spectral thresholds by means of radiative transfer
calculations (RTC). Extended sensitivity studies reveal that thresholds
mainly depend on the solar zenith angle and, hence,
illumination-dependent threshold functions are developed. Areas covered
by snow, ice and mid-/high-level clouds as well as bright/hazy land
surfaces are omitted from the initial classification result by means of
a subsequent cloud-top height test based on MODIS IR band 31 (at 12 µm)
and a NIR/VIS ratio test. The validation of the final fog and low
stratus mask generally shows a satisfactory performance of the scheme.
Validation problems occur due to the late overpass time of the TERRA
platform and the time lag between SYNOP and satellite observations.
Apparent misclassifications are mainly found at the edge of the fog
layers, probably due to over- or underestimation of fog and low stratus
cover in the transition zone from fog to haze.<br />

<p><em>Abstract: A semianalytical algorithm for the retrieval of ice
cloud properties from satellite data is presented. The new method is
based on the semianalytical cloud retrieval algorithm and uses
solutions of the asymptotic radiative transfer theory applicable for
optically thick media. Therefore the new method is much less computer
time expensive than the commonly used lookup table approaches. Usually,
the cloud optical thickness and cloud effective droplet radius are
reported for water and ice clouds even though both parameters are
dependent on the actual crystal shape assumed in the retrieval
procedures. Thus the authors propose to use the reduced optical
thickness (ROT) and the particle absorption length (PAL) for the
characterization of ice clouds. This implies that no a priori or
climatological estimates of the particle shape/size distribution are
necessary and increases the comparability of different cloud retrieval
algorithms, which are built on many different distribution functions.
If still necessary, the retrieved ROT and PAL can easily be transferred
to values of the optical thickness and the cloud effective droplet
radius by assuming any of those size distribution functions. The
developed technique has been applied to data from the NASA EOS Terra
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor. The scene shows
Hurricane Jeanne just before its landfall near the coast of Florida in

<p><em>Abstract: The distinction made by satellite data between ground
fog and low stratus is still an open problem. A proper detection scheme
would need to make a determination between low stratus thickness and
top height. Based on this information, stratus base height can be
computed and compared with terrain height at a specific picture
element. In the current paper, a procedure for making the distinction
between ground fog and low-level stratus is proposed based on Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, flying on board the NASA
Terra and Aqua satellites) daytime data for Germany. Stratus thickness
is alternatively derived from either empirical relationships or a newly
developed retrieval scheme (lookup table approach), which relies on
multiband albedo and radiative transfer calculations. A trispectral
visible–near-infrared (VIS–NIR) approach has been proven to give the
best results for the calculation of geometrical thickness. The
comparison of horizontal visibility data from synoptic observing
(SYNOP) stations of the German Weather Service and the results of the
ground fog detection schemes reveals that the lookup table approach
shows the best performance for both a valley fog situation and an
extended layer of low stratus with complex local visibility structures.
Even if the results are very encouraging [probability of detection
(POD) = 0.76], relatively high percentage errors and false alarm ratios
still occur. Uncertainties in the retrieval scheme are mostly due to
possible collocation errors and known problems caused by comparing
point and pixel data (time lag between satellite overpass and ground
observation, etc.). A careful inspection of the pixels that mainly
contribute to the false alarm ratio reveals problems with thin cirrus
layers and the fog-edge position of the SYNOP stations. Validation
results can be improved by removing these suspicious pixels (e.g.,
percentage error decreases from 28% to 22%).</em></p>

An operational MODIS processing scheme for PC dedicated to direct
broadcasting applications in meteorology and earth sciences.</a><br />

<p><em>Abstract: Since late 1999 the Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the EOS Terra and Aqua platforms is
available (King et al., 1992). NASA has established a Web-Interface for
downloading MODIS data from level 1b upward
(http://www.daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/) but this data still needs pre- and
post-processing. Moreover, research activities focusing on the
development of operational product algorithms still rely on the direct
broadcast of satellite data since an operational data transfer of level
1b MODIS products from the DAAC (~7.5 GB per day for central Europe)
exceeds the intention of the web-interface. Several mostly
mixed-language tools are available for single processing steps but
there is a lack of comprehensive tools which operationally perform pre-
and post-processing of the MODIS data and in addition, allow the
implementation of own or third party higher-level products in the same
framework. Hence the authors implemented an operational MODIS
processing scheme (MOPS) solely based on Fortran and useable on both
Linux and MS-Windows platforms with an extendable interface to
higher-level products and a user-friendly Java GUI. So far the MODIS
cloud mask product ( Ackermann et al., 1998) and two cloud property
retrievals (Nakajima and Nakajima, 1995; Kokhanovsky et al., 2003) not
available from NASA are implemented. An advanced rainfall retrieval and
a fog detection scheme will be available from 2005 on. Moreover the
extendable program interface and the dynamically generated Java GUI
allows an easy integration of algorithms developed by others.</em></p>

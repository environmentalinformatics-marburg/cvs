<p>High altitude ecosystems are still widely perceived as natural and
anthropogenic transformation is generally considered to be concentrated
on lower elevations and late. However, recent studies challenge this
view and for quaternary environmental science and prehistory, the
question where humans retreated to during the driest intervals of the
last 20 ka when lowlands may have become uninhabitable is still
demanding. Based on previous own and third-party research and a total
of four reconnaissances to the study area as part of the preparation of
this research unit, we challenge the initially stated long-held belief.
Given the higher humidity of the African mountains archipelago, the
afro-alpine environments are a potential glacial refuge not only for
plants and animals, but also for humans. Among others, this idea is
backed up by the facts that As a consequence, we postulate not a late
but early afro-alpine occupation expressed as the “Mountain Exile
Hypothesis”. Hence, the research unit will focus on reconstructing the
natural and the anthropogenic history of this afro-alpine environment
in space and time and the identification and quantification of the
natural and anthropogenic drivers and processes that shaped the ecology
evolution of the research area.</p>

approach that links operational, multi-source remote-sensing data with
<em>in-situ</em> observations using machine learning approaches. The
developed models operationally generate time series of climate and
woody densities across the study area, which will be implemented into
the integrative database and will serve the rangeland model as a

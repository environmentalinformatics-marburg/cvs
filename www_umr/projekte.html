<p>The core project "Instrumentation and remote sensing" is responsible
for both (i) the provision of systematic and large-scale measurements
and recordings of meteorological and pedological parameters in all
exploratories and (ii) the provision of remote sensing based, area wide
information on the land cover and land use. Similar to the existing
instrumentation infrastructure, a central archive of remote sensing
products will be set up.</p>

<p>The project establishes a high-resolution, satellite-based
monitoring system for past and present atmospheric (precipitation and
temperature) and land-cover parameters (woody density), which are
relevant for assessing the status of savanna rangelands in the context
of IDESSA. The monitoring system will be based on an eco-climatological
approach that links operational, multi-source remote-sensing data with
<em>in-situ</em> observations using machine learning approaches. The
developed models operationally generate time series of climate and
woody densities across the study area, which will be implemented into
the integrative database and will serve the rangeland model as a
baseline for short-term scenario computations.</p>

<p>With respect to the importance of the atmospheric water budget for
the Kilimanjaro ecosystem and the mutual potential feedbacks between
climate and ecosystem change, this project focuses on the remote
sensing supported analysis of the state and change of ecoclimatological
dynamics as a function of ecosystem disturbances along the elevation
gradient from the savannah to the Helichrysum zone. The main objectives
encompass (i) the measurement and analysis of baseline meteorological
information for the characterization of the research plots and the
local climate dynamics, (ii) the quantification and analysis of the
atmospheric water budget with a special focus on rainfall, fog and
evapotranspiration dynamics along the elevation and disturbance
gradients and (iii) the remote sensing based prediction of ecosystem
properties and biodiversity patterns using high resolution optical
satellite data and aerial LIDAR information.</p>

<p>Data documentation, storage in a central database, continuous
information exchange, scientific coordination and interdisciplinary
data synthesis are essential components for the success and synergistic
value of collaborative projects. The central project Z2 aims at
implementing a central database, at establishing a web-based
communication platform, at coordinating the scientific implementation
of the general study design and at actively fostering the integrative
analysis and publication of data to reach the overall goals of the
Research Unit. In accordance with current DFG regulations, data and
metadata stored in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) will ensure
long-term public accessibility of results. Advantages of existing
database systems and communication platforms will be combined and
tailored to fit the requirements of the proposed research unit.</p>

<p>Mt. Victoria is presumably an Ice Age refuge and one of the
southermost isolated Holarctic mountain islands ranging from 400 to
3,050 m asl. The study area is located within the Natma Taung national
park, Chin state, Myanmar. Presenting a little known nieche for
Himalayan plants, the hotspot is one of the most promising research
sites for Quaternary Biogeography to unveil the evolution of the
archipelago of Holarctic alpine biota in the Palaeotropic southeast
Asian lowland forest. The project&nbsp; is a kick-off initiative for a
long-term research program in the mountain archipelago of alpine biota
in the southeast Himalayan periphery of Myanmar. The project intends to
provide the foundations for future mountain ecology and functional
biodiversity research in the only biodiversity hotspot of the Holarctic
floristic domain.</p>

<p>Free open-source data is ubiquitous (it is everywhere). In addition,
recent availability of free and open analytic software such as R and
numPy  and many others  means that everyone can do state-of-the-art
science by just knowing the basics and letting imagination and
curiosity guide the rest. This site is dedicated to all those
interested in studying the climate of Iran  and with a little tweaking
